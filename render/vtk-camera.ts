// A faithful TypeScript port of the parts of vtkCamera that Slicer's 3D view
// interaction depends on. This replaces SlicerLive's ad-hoc azimuth/elevation/distance
// orbit so the camera follows Slicer's geometry logic exactly.
//
// Ported from VTK/Rendering/Core/vtkCamera.cxx (Azimuth, Elevation, OrthogonalizeViewUp,
// Dolly) and vtkTransform::SetupCamera. Conventions, straight from the source:
//
//   view transform rows (world -> camera basis), built from position/focalPoint/viewUp:
//     row2 "viewPlaneNormal" = normalize(position - focalPoint)      ("back")
//     row0 "viewSideways"    = normalize(cross(viewUp, back))        ("right")
//     row1 "orthoViewUp"     = cross(back, right)                    ("true up")
//
//   Azimuth(a)   : rotate position about the VIEW UP axis through the focal point.
//                  viewUp itself is NOT modified.
//   Elevation(a) : rotate position about axis = -row0 (i.e. -right) through the focal
//                  point. VTK temporarily rotates viewUp for the internal view-transform
//                  computation and then restores the member, so the *effective* up used
//                  downstream is the rotated one — which is why Slicer always follows
//                  Elevation with OrthogonalizeViewUp().
//   OrthogonalizeViewUp() : viewUp = row1 of the current view transform.
//   Dolly(f)     : d = distance / f ; position = focalPoint - d * directionOfProjection.
//                  (f > 1 moves the camera TOWARD the focal point.)
